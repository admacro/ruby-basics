# ==
#   - Same as equal? in Object class, which means it tests for equality of object references
#   - Redefined in most subclasses of Object to compare content of distinct instances
#     - For example, Integer, String, Array, and Hash each has different equality definition
#
# equal?
#   - Compares object identity (object_id).
#   - In other words, equal? tests whether two values refer to the same object
#
# eql?
#   - eql? is synonymous with ==.
#   - Subclasses normally continue this tradition by # aliasing eql? to their
#     overridden == method, but there are exceptions. Numeric types, for
#     example, perform type conversion across ==, but not across eql?

a = [1,2]

# when Hash objects are compared using ==
# size must be equal
# values are compared using ==
# keys are compared using eql?(other)
#   - eql? method returns true if obj and other refer to the same hash key.
#   - This is used by Hash to test members for equality.
