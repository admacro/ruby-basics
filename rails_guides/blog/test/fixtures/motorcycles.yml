# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#

########
# NOTE #
########
# Even the data entries have no actual data, Rails will still create two records with nil
# values for columns with no default value.
#
# #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Vehicle id: 298486374, type: nil, color: nil, price: nil, created_at: "2018-03-29 12:28:19", updated_at: "2018-03-29 12:28:19">, #<Vehicle id: 980190962, type: nil, color: nil, price: nil, created_at: "2018-03-29 12:28:19", updated_at: "2018-03-29 12:28:19">]>
#
# This is no problem if you have only one fixture like this. But when you have another fixture
# with same empty data entries like these, Rails will complain with following error:
#
# Error:
# MotorcycleTest#test_should_save:
# ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique: SQLite3::ConstraintException: UNIQUE constraint failed: vehicles.id: INSERT INTO "vehicles" ("created_at", "updated_at", "id") VALUES ('2018-03-29 12:27:23.168787', '2018-03-29 12:27:23.168787', 980190962)
#
# So, it's better to remove all of the empty data entries in fixture files.
#
#one: {}
# column: value
#
#two: {}
# column: value
